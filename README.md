Hello, all!

I appreciate your consideration for the developer position at Product Plan. I must say, I actually had a pretty fun time with this homework project. This was my first time using React in creating a project (I have gone through some React Code Academy courses before). I've also used Angular so am pretty familiar with NPM and concepts like data binding.

My mindset in working on this project in the allotted timeframe was to get what I could important functionality wise complete. I left some things for cleanup later such as making the quarterly dates line up just right. If I could go back, I definitely would have focused more on adding some test coverage. I have never used Jest before, so I am working on becoming more familiar with it. However, I have used Jasmine and the two seem fairly similar from a quick look.

I also noticed some typos in the second tip window. I left them in for exact specifications sake but in a real job scenario, I would have reached out to the design team or product owner to get clarification on what it should say.

Thanks again for your team and consideration. Please contact me with any questions.
Catherine (Cat) Ireton =^.\_.^= ∫





## Create React App Notes

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
